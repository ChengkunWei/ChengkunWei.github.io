## Bio

I recieved my PhD degree in the Computer Science department of Zhejiang University in 2021 and served as a postdoctoral researcher from 2021 to 2024. My research focuses on heterogeneous computing and data security, including cloud computing, high-performance network, trusted execution environment (TEE) and LLM Security. My papers are published on top-tier conference/journal like SIGCOMM, ATC, HPCA, and also on CCS, NDSS, TIFS, and TDSC. I received the **NDSS 2024 Distinguished Paper Award** and have got fundings from the National Natural Science Foundation the Zhejiang Province Postdoctoral Funding Project. 


I hope my students:
- have interest in computer system
- have ideals and pursuits, and can analyze problems well 
- have a favorite sport and stick to it
